    "Welcome to my final project Jupyter Notebook. This notebook will accompany the video presentation for the project. Today, we will use the skills developed in this class to solve a supervised machine learning problem. We will use a loan default set sourced from Kaggle which contains 16 predictor demographic variables and 1 response/target variable on whether the person defaulted on their loan or not. We will begin by preprocessing the data and performing some EDA with the dataset. Then, using sklearn and the skills developed in the course we will tune and test all the model types from this course and evaluate them with a test data set. Success will be locating and presenting the best machine learning approach to predicting loan default. Solving issues such as these with high accuracy is very useful in the financial world as borrowers and lenders seek to mitigate risk in an ever evolving economy. Thank you for joining me today and I hope you enjoy my report.\n",

    "Loading in our dataset we can see we have over 255,000 records! Because my computer struggles greatly with large datasets, we will take a sample of 2000 loans to train our data on. The dataset has roughly 90% of entries where the loan was not defaulted and because we have significant issues with balancing, we will balance the dataset ourselves for a more well rounded evaluation later on. The next 2 blocks of code load in our code and process our 2000 loan record dataset. "

Age is the age of the borrower, income is the total annual income of the borrower, loan amount is the total principle on the loan, credit score is the borrower's credit score measured by FICO, months employed is the number of months the borrower has been employed, NumCreditLines is the number of credit lines the borrower currently has, interest rate is the annual interest rate of the loan, loan term is the length of the loan in months, DTI Ratio is the debt to income ratio for then borrower, education is the highest level of education the borrower achieved, EmploymentType is whether the person is full time or part time or unemployed, marital status is whether the borrower is married or not, HasMortgage is binary whether the person has a mortgage as well, HasDependents is a yes/no whether they have children, LoanPurpose is a categorical variable describing the purpose of the loan (home, auto, education etc.), HasCoSigner is a yes/no whether the borrower has a cosigner, and finally default is the target variable describing whether the borrower defaulted on the loan."

We will use several classification methods learned in this class: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forests, Boosting, and SVM. We will tune each model and then fit the trained model on the test set, comparing it to the real values and using ROC_AUC, accuracy, recall, precision, and a confusion matrix to identify the best model. The next chunks will walkthrough tuning each type of model and validating them with the discussed metrics. Please review the next code lines and join again for the discussion after this section."

    "As we monitor the results from above we see that the random forest model performs best out of all models. Outperforming all models in accuracy with about 74% and then having the highest ROC_AUC, precision, and recall. As we saw in class random forest are often some of the best performing models, along with boosting models, SVM, and deep learning. Because we did not study deep learning in this course, I did not apply those methods, but it would be very interesting to see the results from Neural Networks and this data. Boosting was also a strong contender, with Gradient Boosting and Ada Boost following with the second and third highest validation metrics, which agrees with our learning in class. We saw that often these models can be strong with different types of data and in this case random forests was the best approach. A curious result was one of the worst performing models was SVM, a usually well performing model. It took about 15 hours to tune the SVM model, for it to only produce a prediction of no defaults in the test set. After investigation, nothing turned up as to why this occured, but perhaps retuning the model with more data may allow for a better predictor. Because my computer could barely handle SVM on this scale to begin with, I decided to skip this further investigation until I can get a better computer. Additionally, our random forest model has strong metrics with close to 75% accuracy. Going forward, lenders and borrowers can analyze loan data to predict whether a loan default could be imminent based on the predictor variables. Then, lenders and borrowers can quickly begin mitigation techniques to save the loan and assist both parties. Our model tuned here can have huge impacts in the real world. Next steps can include computer upgrades to run the training on the entire dataset and produce a very high quality model. I am very happy with the results from this model and thank you for joining me today!"
